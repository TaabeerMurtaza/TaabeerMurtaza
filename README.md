- 👋 Hi, I’m @TaabeerMurtaza.
- 👀 Interested in Python3, Linux, Web Development (Django), Web scraping.
- 🌱 Currently learning Django, Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that fits my qualification level. I want to gain (practical) experience in coding. I have tried HTML, CSS, tailwind, bootstrap, PHP, Laravel (5.8), Python3, Web scraping, Django, among other stuff. I have no job experience and I am open to participating in any project. I'm self taught and I like to learn new stuff (part of the reason I learnt to code in the first place). 

I hope you hated my bio. I neither glitter nor am I gold. Just another guy passionate to learn. Trying to move forward into coding and looking for projects. Anything matters...

- 📫 For contacting, mail me at tabeermurtaza@gmail.com.
